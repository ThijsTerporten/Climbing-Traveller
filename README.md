# The Climbing Traveller

This project will cover the best places available to climb outdoors, covering bouldering and lead-climbing in Europe.
The idea behind the project is to inform visitors and give them idea's about where to go on their next climbing trip.
While providing them different links to purchase any new gear and give them the option to subscribe to a newsletter to recieve monthly updates
about new locations to consider for their next trip.

## Showcase

A deployed version of my website can be found [here.](https://thijsterporten.github.io/Milestone-1/index.html)

## UX

The end user of this project can be anyone interested in finding a location to go on holiday and climb at the same time, or even someone that already
booked a holiday and is looking for a location near that place to go on a climbing trip.
The end user of this project would like to find clear descriptions of the locations listed:
* Type of climbing.
* Level of climbing in the area.
* Country.
* Accomodations. 
* Other things to do in the area.

The end goal of the project is to get people excited about climbing and inform them about outdoor climbing.

### UX stories

* As a user I want to learn more about outdoor climbing locations.
* As a user I would like to get inspiration for my next climbing trip.
* Do I need permits or certificates to climb outdoors?
* What equipment do I need to climb outdoor?
* Is there any way to learn more about climbing outdoor in general?
* As a user I would like to be updated about more locations I could visit in the futere.
* I already booked my holiday, is there a location I could go and climb near me.

## Strategy

### User Needs

As a user the site has to be accessible on mobile, tablet and all browsers. Information should be clearly laid out, informative and easy to read.
The site navigation needs to be optimal to move to the preferred section of the user.

### Business vision

The purpose of this project is to give users new idea's and a clear overview of the area of their next climbing trip.
The site also gives the users easy acces to external sites to buy new gear or an option to subscribe to a newsletter to 
give them updates about cool new climbing locations.

## Scope

I want my users to easily learn about outdoor climbing and some cool locations to check out. While having the option to find gear needed to start 
climbing outside available on a different page of the website.

## Structure

This project is a multi page website. Due to the large amount of information it wouldn't be smart to lay everything out in a single page.
It was originally designed as a single page project but after having the mentoring session with Antonija this was quickly changed.
For clarity and overview the project is divided in 4 pages. One for each type of climbing, one for the Home page, and one for the gear links.
On entering the landing page the user is greeted by a stunning image one might expect when going on a climbing trip. The user will then naturally find a small description 
of what the site is about and then naturally find a form to allow the user to subscribe to a newsletter. To get to the different parts the user can use the navigation
menu to easily find the type of climbing they are interested in or the section of the site to find new gear. 
Every other page is designed keeping this layout in mind as this provides intuitve learning for the user.
